## Arrange for Care of Deceased's Home

If your loved one lived alone, securing their home is an important step in settling their affairs. Taking action early can help prevent security risks, property damage, and missed bills while allowing time for thoughtful decisions about the home’s future.

### Steps to Secure the Home

1. **Lock & Secure the Property**
   - Ensure all doors, windows, and gates are locked to prevent unauthorized entry.
   - Collect spare keys from family, friends, neighbors, or hiding spots (e.g., under a mat or in a lockbox).
   - If there’s concern about unknown keyholders, consider changing the locks.
   - Notify a trusted neighbor or local police if the home will be vacant for an extended period.
   - Remove valuables (e.g., jewelry, cash, electronics) if the home will remain empty, storing them in a safe place like a safety deposit box.

2. **Notify Key Contacts**
   - Contact the homeowner’s insurance provider to report the death and confirm coverage remains active (vacant homes may require special policies).
   - Inform family members, close friends, neighbors, or a property manager about who will oversee the home’s care.
   - If the deceased rented, reach out to the landlord to discuss lease terms, termination options, or plans to vacate the property.

3. **Manage Mail & Deliveries**
   - Set up mail forwarding through the **USPS website** (www.usps.com) to your address or another designated location.
   - Cancel subscriptions such as newspapers, magazines, or meal delivery services—check credit card statements or email for active accounts.
   - Visit the home periodically or ask someone to check the mailbox for bills, legal notices, or other important documents.

4. **Maintain Utilities & Property Upkeep**
   - Keep essential utilities (electricity, water, heat) active to prevent issues like frozen pipes or mold, especially in colder months.
   - Arrange for lawn mowing, snow removal, or basic maintenance to keep the property presentable and deter break-ins.
   - Pause or cancel non-essential services like cable or internet if no one will use them.
   - Address urgent repairs (e.g., a leaking roof or broken window) by hiring a professional or coordinating with insurance if covered.

5. **Consider Home Security**
   - Install timers or smart plugs for indoor lights to simulate occupancy.
   - Check for an existing security system and ensure it’s active; if none exists, consider a basic system (e.g., Ring, SimpliSafe).
   - If the home uses smart locks or cameras, update access codes and monitor them, or disconnect if they’re no longer needed.

### Planning for the Home’s Future

Once immediate security is handled, you’ll need to plan for the home’s long-term status:
- **Mortgage or Rent Payments:** Check for an outstanding mortgage or lease agreement. Contact the lender or landlord to discuss payment options or estate responsibilities.
- **Estate Executor’s Role:** If the home is part of the estate, the executor or administrator should review the will, trust, or deed to determine ownership and next steps.
- **Selling or Transferring Ownership:** If the home will be sold, inherited, or transferred, consult a real estate agent, attorney, or probate professional for guidance on valuation, taxes, and legal requirements.

### Additional Tips
- Document your actions (e.g., who you notified, repairs made) for estate records.
- If overwhelmed, delegate tasks to family or hire a property management service.
- Seek legal advice if ownership is unclear or disputed.

Taking these steps ensures your loved one’s home remains safe and maintained, reducing stress during an already difficult time. For further assistance, consider contacting a real estate attorney, estate planner, or local professionals familiar with probate processes.
