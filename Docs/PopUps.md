    *   Compile a list of close friends and extended family who need to be informed.

## Informing Your Loved One’s Doctor

Notifying your loved one’s doctor of their passing is an important step, especially if they were under medical care. It ensures proper record updates and may be necessary for final paperwork.

**Steps to Notify the Doctor:**

1.  **Determine the Right Contact Person:**

    *   Identify which doctor needs to be informed—this may be a primary care physician, specialist, or hospice provider.
2.  **Make the Call:**

    *   Contact the doctor’s office and ask to speak with a staff member or nurse if the doctor is unavailable.
3.  **Provide Essential Information:**

    *   Share the deceased’s full name and date of passing.
    *   If the death occurred under medical care, ask whether the doctor will be signing the death certificate or if it needs to go through a coroner or medical examiner.
4.  **Ask About Next Steps:**

    *   Some offices may require additional paperwork or provide guidance on accessing medical records.
    *   If the death was unexpected, the doctor may need to report it to the medical examiner.
    *   If an autopsy is required, ask how it may affect the death certificate timeline.
5.  **Close Any Remaining Medical Matters:**

    *   If the doctor was involved in long-term care or treatment, ask if any additional steps are needed to finalize medical records or notifications.

## Notifying Your Loved One’s Employer

If your loved one was employed, notifying their employer promptly ensures that final wages and benefits are properly handled, helping to ease financial stress.

**Steps to Notify the Employer:**

1.  **Prepare Required Documents**

    *   Employers typically require a death certificate to process final payments and benefits.
2.  **Contact the Employer Promptly**

    *   Call the human resources department or, for small businesses, speak directly with a supervisor or owner.
    *   If you are not the next of kin or an emergency contact, HR may only provide limited information.
3.  **Ask About Final Pay and Benefits**

    *   Unpaid wages, vacation, or sick time that may be owed.
    *   Death benefits, pensions, or 401(k) funds.
    *   Employer-provided life insurance and how to file a claim.
    *   Whether dependents (spouse, children) remain eligible for health coverage, including COBRA continuation.

**Note:** The employer may provide forms to request unpaid wages, pensions, life insurance, or other benefits. Ask about these when you contact them.

**Understand Benefit Payouts**

*   Some benefits, such as life insurance and pensions, are paid directly to named beneficiaries.
*   Other payments, like a final paycheck, may be issued to the estate and require probate.
